The unzipped folder contains a lot of files which I will explain.
My challenge in this competition is that I could not use google colab because of the big size of the .tif files.
Also, visualizing and saving the maps took a lot of memory.

After running the codes successfully, if you want to check the maps too, you can uncomment the code if you have a laptop of more than 4gb ram.

FILES IN THE FOLDER
features_extraction_1.ipynb
features_extraction_2.ipynb
features_extraction_3.ipynb
features_extraction_4.ipynb
train.ipynb
test.ipynb
modelling.ipynb
datasets folder(data from competition)
[then all other maps created by running the code]


STEPS TO GET A REPRODUCIBLE CODE
In this project, I worked with many libraries and they are mentioned in the requirements.txt. Please, run the code in a jupyter notebook environment,
this is the only environment i could test the model before the deadline for submission of codes.
Ensure, you install all the packages, I chose jupyter notebook as the environment because it has some prebuild or pre-installed packages with it.

To run the code, follow these steps in the correct order.
First run the features_extraction_1.ipynb file, it can take 5 minutes
Then run the features_extraction_2.ipynb file, it can take 5 minutes
Then run the features_extraction_3.ipynb file, it can take 10 minutes
Then run the features_extraction_4.ipynb file, it can take 5 minutes
Then run the train.ipynb file, it can take 2 hours
Then run the train.ipynb file, it can take 5 hours
Then run the modelling.ipynb file, it can take 5 minutes


The result of the model is sub.csv which you will find in the unzipped folder
