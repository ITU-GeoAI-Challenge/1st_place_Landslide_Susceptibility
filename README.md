# 1st_place_Landslide_Susceptibility

Landslides pose a significant threat to infrastructure, property, and human life on a global scale. The Italian Alps, with their steep slopes and geological characteristics, are particularly vulnerable to such hazards. Thus, the aim of this challenge is to create a landslide susceptibility map for a specific watershed using geospatial environmental datasets and advanced machine learning models. The final output will provide a comprehensive visualisation of the spatial probability of an area being affected by a landslide. This information can greatly assist local authorities in implementing effective mitigation measures to prevent and minimise damages caused by landslides. This product will contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 11 and 13, which focus on creating sustainable and resilient cities and combating climate change effects, respectively.

Objectives:

1. The objective is to establish techniques for landslide susceptibility mapping at a resolution of 5 m/pixel, focusing on shallow landslide types.

2. One of the key challenges is developing an approach for what we can call the zero-case scenario of the training dataset, i.e., regions with no landslide occurrence.

3. To compute the landslide susceptibility map, it is crucial to carefully select and incorporate pertinent environmental factors such as slope angle, aspect, lithology, and others that can significantly impact slope stability.

4. Finally, the accuracy of the proposed method must be thoroughly tested to ensure its reliability in accurately identifying areas with a high probability of landslide occurrence.
